The steps to spin up this rails example are as follows:
1. bundle install
2. setup a mysql server and edit the database.yml to reflect your settings
3. create, migrate and seed the database - the seed should take a little less than 2 minutes.

The seed data can be recreated at any time by dropping, creating, migrating and seeding the db via rake.
